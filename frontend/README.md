# EMD Precious Metals Calculator - Frontend

This is the javascript version of this app. A typescript version is being built in a private GitHub repository and will be converted to a public one once it's working. The front end is built with React 18 and Redux Toolkit. I chose to use Vite as the build tool due to it's build performance and modernized customizable configuration.
